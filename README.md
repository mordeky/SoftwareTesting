## Course Introduction
**Dear All**, we'll start our course today!! I know that you all have the ambitions to be a great software engineer like James Arthur Gosling (the father of Java) and Donald Ervin Knuth (the author of the Art of Computer Programming) in the future. To this end, let’s start from this course, *Software Quality Assurance and Testing Techniques* (briefly, **SQAT** or just **Software Testing**).

I believe **TDD** (**Test-Driven Development**) is a great idea to guide us to build a huge project, where we try our best to be. So, let’s try to learn as much as we can in this course. I’ll use the task-or-experiment oriented method to show you how to study this course. That is, I’ll give you PPT (.ppt or .pdf) and lab task (.docx) for each lecture. Your final aim is to complete the lab task by submitting your lab report as well as source code to the Chaoxing System in .zip package.

<!--### Courseware Clone and Lab Report Submission-->
### Labwork Submission
<!--
The courseware and the relative materials are relased in my giteee (码云) project: https://gitee.com/mordeky/SoftwareTesting. You can download it by directly clicking the “克隆/下载” button. However, I strongly suggest you to clone the courseware by using TortoiseGit: https://tortoisegit.org/download/, as this course will be continuously updated. You’ll find TortoiseGit is really helpful.

Your labwork including your **lab report** and the related **source codes**, should be submitted in the [Chaoxing System](http://i.mooc.chaoxing.com).

### Assessment Methods
You might concern the Assessment Methods at the end of this term. I list them below:

Final Score = Formative Score (50%) + Final Exam Score (50%)

Formative Score = Lab Report (80%) + Discussion (20%)

Final Exam Score: **Closed-Book**!!
